# Create Videos

The process of **creating a video** with **Biomovies** is really **straightforward**. Once the edition of the movie is finished, just click one of the **three options** available to start recording.

## Create New Preview 

A preview is, in fact, a **screen record**. **Biomovies** plays the **Timeline** in real time and records it. Thus, the resolution is not standard, but **depends on your screen**. 

For recording a **new preview**, go to menu _Create Video > New Preview_ or use the shortcut âŒ˜/Ctrl + P. This action will put **Biomovies** in full screen and will open a **new window** as well.

In this new window, users can choose the **resolution** and the **frame rate** for the new video. 

* As explained before, the resolution **depends on the screen** on which **Biomovies** is being executed. Therefore, if you have a Full HD monitor, the movie can have this resolution. All the available resolutions have the **aspect ratio** of the screen.
* As for the frame rate, users can choose between **25, 20 or 10 frames per second**.

Once the _Record_ button is pressed, the **render** process starts. This **render** process consists of recording the movie in **real time**, so it will take the same length of the **Timeline**. After the **render** process is finished, it starts the **video generation**. This part can take more or less time depending on the **resolution** chosen and the **resources** of the computer where **Biomovies** is being executed. Once the **video generation** is finished, a system dialog is shown to ask the user **where to save** the video.

All the **Preview Videos** generated by **Biomovies** are in **MP4** format.
